				<p class="modal-content">My name is Roydon Jeffrey and I am an inspiring IOS and Web Developer who recently graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. My journey as a developer started in December, 2014 when I first found out about computer programming. I had never saw a line of code nor did I know that it existed. My emotions was too powerful for me to even control, so I dove right into it and never looked back since. The fact that I can make a computer do almost anything I want it to do with just a few words and symbols is the most blind blowing thing to me. Sometimes I feel guilty and hold myself responsible for not learning about this amazing skill much earlier in life. But since I can't do anything about it now, I work with a chip on my shoulders to try and catch up for all the lost years I could have been programming. Even though that's not possible, I like to believe that it is. All I ask is that you give me a chance and I'll show you what I can do with a little training and guidance.</p>

				<p class="modal-content">Since I don't want so sound too ambitious, I want to become one of the best African American Computer Programmers/Software Engineers in the world. In order to achieve that goal, there are some steps that I must follow:<br>
					1). Get a job by October 23rd, 2015 at an organization where me and the company can grow together.<br>
					2). Participate in code/educational activities for roughly 10-12 hours on a daily basis.<br>
					3). Surround myself with programmers/people who are better than myself.<br>
					4). Stay current and updated in the Tech industry.<br>
					5). Always remain a student at all times.
